NetProg-Project-2

Jacob Lane - laurej2@rpi.edu
Aidan Wenzel - wenzea@rpi.edu

Description:
This program is a server for playing Rock-Paper-Scissors between two people over a network. The program is setup using ZeroConf.

Issues encountered:
Not related to the homework specifically, but both of us happened to travel over Spring Break without internet access, making it difficult to work and communicate with each other.

Time taken:
Approx. 20 hours total between us, including time to research the technologies behind the project.

Breakdown of work:
Jacob - RPS game logic and memory management
Aidan - Zeroconf networking and client connections
